hobbyisms
=========

These are projects that i've written just because they were interesting.

  - Clock_1_0: An Arduino (mega) based digital alarm clock
  - messages: PHP based pm style messaging service
  - iofs: A fuse filesystem to control i/o on an arduino
  - porthack: A windows batch file to automate a NAT punching port forward. Requires plink and netcat
  - stack: An implementation of integer stacks in C
  - rfile: My web based file manager. Written in PHP for Windows, my first "big" project, and it shows.
  - loose c files:
    - tun_vpn.c: Unencrypted vpn using a tun virtual network interface, written in C;
  - bandwidth_monitor: A graphical bandwidth monitor written in C and PHP, uses postgresql. Remains rather inefficient.
